Messing about with HTML5 game engines

Diary
========
 * Look at physicsJS
     - Look at RequireJS
     - Got working, learned a bit about physics engines in general
     - Documentation was okay but a bit tricky to follow and incomplete
 * Look at Box2D
     - Bailed because people on the internets refuted it's suitability for mobile
     - Stumbled across Turbulenz in the process (http://biz.turbulenz.com/)
 * Look at Turbulenz
     - Very comprehensive platform, not just a lib but a suite of tools also
     - At first seemed fairly dictative but after working through it's just offering a suite of optional tools we otherwise piece together ourselves (server apis, minification, concat, cache-busting etc)
     - Checked out the games on http://ga.me - very very impressive
     - Checked out the [http://biz.turbulenz.com/samples#sample-modal/samplepage/sample_assets/physics2d.canvas.release.html/samplesrc/sample_assets/physics2d.js.html](physics demo) great performance, even on mobile
 * Turbulenz walkthroughs done
